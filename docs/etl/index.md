# ETL

Automatically handles the authentication with OneLake in read and load operations.

The `msfabricutils.etl` module provides a set of functions and classes to facilitate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.

The docs provide some examples on how to use the functions, however more usecases can be found in the tests section on github.
